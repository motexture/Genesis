# Genesis

## Overview

Project Genesis is an exploratory venture in creating an artificial neural architecture inspired by the structural dynamics of the human brain, utilizing the flexibility of PyTorch. 

The objective of Genesis is to mimic the complex interactivity of neurons within a biological brain. While the current performance of the model might not be optimal, it provides a solid foundation for understanding and improving neural architectures further.

## Features

- **Configurable Architecture**: Genesis can be customized extensively through a configuration file, allowing different setups of neurons, dendrites, and synaptic connections.
- **Modular Design**: The model components such as input processing, neural sections, and output mechanisms are separated into distinct modules, making it easier to tweak individual aspects or add new functionalities.
- **Dynamic Neuron Connections**: Neurons in the model can dynamically connect with their neighbors, facilitating a more organic form of neural interaction.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Acknowledging that the initial performance might not be optimal, the architecture is designed to be open for enhancements and optimizations.

## Technical Description

- **Neural Components**: 
  - Neurons, Dendrites, Axons, and Synapses are modeled with distinct behaviors and characteristics, reflecting their biological counterparts.
- **Input and Output Systems**: 
  - Supports multiple input and output modes, facilitating the use of the model for different types of neural network tasks such as causal language modeling and sequence classification.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: 
  - Implements attention mechanisms in some neurons, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input data dynamically.
